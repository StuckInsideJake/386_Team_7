1.  **Description**

> *Provide 1-2 paragraphs to describe your system. This will help us to
> remember what your system is about.*
>
> The purpose behind our application is to encourage young people to
> develop healthy eating habits and to encourage them to partake in
> daily or more consistent exercise habits. We aim to motivate healthy
> eating and participation in physical activity through providing an
> easy to navigate application and interface in general. Furthermore,
> users will be able to create self-set dietary and or exercise goals to
> be tracked as they use the app. By creating a tracking system, users
> will be able to easily see whether they are meeting their goals and
> can opt to edit their goals as needed. Along with goal setting and
> changing, users will also be able to set up notifications that meet
> their needs from within their profile.
>
> Other features of the application include an exercises tab and a
> recipes tab. From these sections of the app, users will be able to
> search for exercises or recipes, respectively. Each exercise will
> contain a description of how to complete the activity and each of the
> recipes available to the users will contain the necessary ingredients
> and description of how to make the meal. Overall, by providing one
> location for users to keep track of eating habits, while having access
> to exercises and recipe suggestions, the app will help to encourage
> users to develop and maintain their healthy habits.

2.  **Verification** **(tests)**

> *Verification aims to ensure that you correctly developed the
> product.*
>
> **2.1.** **Unit Test**
>
> *Unit test is an automated test that aims to verify the behavior of a
> component isolated from the rest of the system. For this deliverable,
> you should have automated tests for the main components of your
> project. Provide the following information:*
>
> *2.1.1. Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., JUnit,
> unittest, pytest, etc.):*
>
> flutter_test
>
> *2.1.2. Link to your GitHub folder where your automated unit tests are
> located.*
>
> https://github.com/cpociask00/386_Team_7/tree/main/test
>
> *2.1.3. An example of a test case that makes use of mock objects.
> Include in your answer a GitHub link to the class being tested and to
> the test.*
>
> https://github.com/cpociask00/386_Team_7/blob/main/lib/main.dart
>
> *2.1.4. A print screen showing the result of the unit tests
> execution.*
>
> ![](media/image1.png){width="6.5in" height="1.8611111111111112in"}
>
> ***2.2.*** **Integration Test**
>
> *An integration test is an automated test that verifies the
> implementation of a business rule that involves multiple components
> with the goal of certifying that they work together to produce the
> expected result. They are often performed in the same test platform as
> the unit tests. Provide the following information:*
>
> *2.2.1. Test framework you used to develop your tests: flutter_test or
> something else idfk*
>
> *2.2.2. Link to your GitHub folder where your automated integration
> tests are located.*
>
> *2 2.3. An example of an integration test. Include in your answer a
> GitHub link to the test and an explanation about what parts of the
> system are being exercised by this test.*
>
> *2.2.4. A print screen showing the result of the integration tests
> execution.*
>
> **2.3.** **Acceptance**
>
> *An acceptance test is a test that verifies the correct implementation
> of a feature from the user interface perspective. An acceptance test
> is a black box test (the system is tested without knowledge about its
> internal implementation). Provide the following information:*
>
> *2.3.1. Test framework you used to develop your tests (e.g., Selenium,
> Katalon Studio, Espresso2, Cucumber, etc.):*
>
> *2.3.2. Link to your GitHub folder where your automated acceptance
> tests are located.*
>
> *2.3.3. An example of an acceptance test. Include in your answer a
> GitHub link to the test and an explanation about the tested feature.*
>
> *2.3.4. A print screen/video showing the acceptance test execution.*

3.  **Validation** **(user evaluation)**

> *Validation aims to ensure that you developed the right product. You
> started the software inception by talking to users and stakeholders.
> Now it is time to check if you are on the right track by conducting
> some user evaluation on the actual system. Include in this deliverable
> the following information:*
>
> **Script:** *The script should have the tasks that you will give to
> the user, what you are going to collect, and what you are going to
> ask. Do not forget to add questions about the users' general
> impressions. You can ask open questions (e.g., How would you describe
> the homepage of our app? How do you compare our system to the
> competitor X?) or closed questions (On a scale of 1 to 10, how would
> you rate the layout of our application? On the same scale, how likely
> would you use the system in its current state?). Take a look at the
> inception and requirements deliverables to help create the script (aim
> to check if you are achieving your initial goals and if the features
> are implemented in a satisfactory way).*
>
> **Script Questions:**

1.  On a scale of 1-5 how would you rate the functionality of our app?

2.  On a scale of 1-5 how would you rate the look/style of our app?

3.  How would you describe the layout of the app? Do you find it easy or
    > hard to navigate?

4.  What sections of the app would you use the most?

5.  What improvements would you recommend?

6.  Did you find any bugs/errors in the app?

> **Script Tasks:**

1.  Users will navigate through the exercise tab and select exercises.

2.  Users will navigate through the recipes tab and select recipes.

3.  Users will navigate through the user profile tab and interact with
    > the different functions the tab provides.

> **What we are going to collect:**

1.  Is the usability up to par with what we described in our
    > requirements and inception?

2.  Is our chosen theme easy on the eyes/pleasant to look at?

3.  Does our exercise and recipes tabs provide easy selection?

> **Results:** *Conduct the user evaluation with at least 3 users.
> Report the data that you collected.*

Austin Burns:

> From our questions and tasks we gave Austin, he noted the
> functionality of our app was user friendly and simplistic in design.
> Austin also noted also that it was easy to navigate the interface
> while utilizing the app. As Austin utilized the exercise and recipe
> tab, they noted the recipe tab was a little difficult to navigate but
> it was helpful overall to see the recipe and time needed to make it.
> They said the exercise tab was simple and easy on the eyes and quick
> to access. Austin was first confused that the exercise and recipe tabs
> were scrollable but quickly figured it out. Austin mentioned that he
> had to figure out how to get more information about an exercise or
> recipe on his own. The exercise app would prove most useful in his
> case as he states that he spends a lot of time outdoors and would
> benefit from inspiration for new exercises. In his eyes, Austin
> thought that the Hawaiian theme was very appropriate for the app and
> that the color was "inspiring". Overall, Austin rates our app a 3.5/5
> because he notes that the app lacks content in the fashion that there
> could be more exercises and recipes to choose from.

Chris Tatlock:

> From our questions and tasks we gave the user, Chris responded that he
> felt that the app was too similar to other exercise products that he
> uses. But he did mention that it was much easier to use as it is
> simple and everything is organized in a way that is easy to find. He
> also likes the diary as he can mess around with it where he can use
> the product other than recording what exercise he did or what he ate.
> As for the theme which is hawaiian based, he felt it wasn't too
> appropriate as he sees Hawaii as a place to relax and that exercise
> isn't too relaxing unless you are walking your dog. Overall, he felt
> the app was similar but had its differences compared to others and
> that it was a product he doesn't mind using if it is free and after
> the product gets expanded with more exercise or diet options as right
> now it is very limited. Overall he said right now he rates it 3/5 but
> it can be improved.

James Goodall:

> From our questions and tasks we gave the user, James first responded
> with a rating score of 3.5/5 because he felt that the app was simple
> to use and organized with a theme that is pleasing to the eye and
> everything is very easy to use, but he felt that some things are
> redundant such as calendar since his phone already has it (he also
> said it isn't a crime to have it too). He liked the theme because he
> loved the activities he did when he traveled to Hawaii such as beach
> volleyball or surfing so he suggested adding activities based on
> location. For example, a tab inside exercise that has different
> locations such as beach, mountain, lake, grassland and add activities
> based on the selected location such as hiking or rock climbing for
> mountain, fishing or swimming in lake, soccer or tag on grassland, and
> finally volleyball and surfing on beach.
>
> **Reflections:** *Reflect on what you observed. Some questions that
> you can explore: What features worked well? What can be changed? How
> is the learning curve of your system? Did the users perform the tasks
> as you expected? Did the users' actions produce the 3 results they
> expected? What did the users like the most? Is your value proposition
> accomplished?*
>
> The main thing that we got from the user feedback and tests that we
> gave them was that our app is indeed easy to navigate and simplistic
> in nature. We wanted our app to be a breeze to work with and make sure
> that the users aren't spending too much time figuring out the fine
> details like where to find their profile or how to select clickable
> objects like recipes and exercises. What could have been changed was
> adding a little more description to certain aspects of the app such as
> instructions on how to scroll and click. We went for simplicity but
> judging from the interviews, we might've gone a little overboard. A
> sentence or two might've helped to tell users that a certain page is
> scrollable or that to view more information, simply click on the
> image. Continuing on the topic of simplicity, the navigation of our
> app was a success. Users reported that they had an easy time finding
> different portions of the app. This also leads into an easy learning
> curve. The only thing that hindered the learning curve was that users
> were a little confused on things like scrolling the page or clicking
> on objects as mentioned earlier. The script actions went well with our
> users.
