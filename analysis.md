1.  **System Description**

> *In the initial paragraph, provide a brief textual description of your
> system. This description must contain the problem statement, the
> product position statement, and the value proposition of your system
> (refined versions of what you presented in D.2). The following
> paragraphs should describe the key requirements of the system. This
> description should be consistent with D.2 stakeholders, requirements,
> use cases, and user stories --however, refinements are welcome. Use
> Boldevery time that you use a noun that is a class in your model. Use
> italics every time that you use a noun that is an attribute in your
> model. Use underline every time that you use a noun or verb that is an
> association in your model.*

Our system's main focus is improving the health of young adults through
the use of a mobile application. Our app aims to tackle one of the many
issues that plague most individuals that attempt to live a healthy
lifestyle, lack of motivation. While many people attempt to live a
healthy lifestyle, most find themselves struggling to maintain the tasks
of achieving their goals on a daily basis. The result of this type of
scenario can lead to devastating health effects including heart disease,
one of the top killers in our country today.

*My Okalino* is being developed so young adults can build and maintain
healthy habits. In order to encourage daily participation, a gaming
experience is implemented in their daily lives in order for them to
progress on their health-related goals. With the use of a gameplay
element, the app aims to maintain consistent use and help sustain the
longevity of the individuals health goals. The gameplay is supported
through a combination of a calorie diary and exercise log maintained by
the user. This diary and log will translate to the game helping the user
progress through the story and daily challenges. The implementation of
an interactive game helps set us apart from other apps in our field such
as MyFitnessApp from Under Armor or Health Pal from Digit Grove.

The main stakeholders for our app are app users, developers and the
competitors. The app users can use the product and give feedback such as
suggestions and/or improvements. The developers are responsible for
developing the app as well as listening to the users. They are also
responsible for updating the rpg aspect of the game to keep it
interesting for users. As developers, we are responsible for keeping the
app in working condition and responding to users that report problems or
bugs. The competitors allow developers to understand what works and what
doesn't work in a health app. A key requirement of the system is a
feedback report that allows users to give us recommendations, ideas or
bugs/issues so we may change it in a reasonable amount of time. Another
key requirement is an exercise session where the user can follow the
recommended time session provided by the system that caters to the user
to provide an effective experience in the user's health goals. The next
key requirement is a food system where users get a mix of meals
recommendations that provides balanced nutrients to improve the user's
immune system and diet. The most important key requirement is the game
system where the user can experience a RPG game where real life actions
have an impact on the experience gained in the game, so the more you are
on track, the further you will progress in game.

2.  **Model**

> *Provide the conceptual model of your system as a UML class diagram.
> Represent proper cardinalities (multiplicities) for all associations.
> Also include the association names. The model must have at least 10
> classes. You can add requirements in the system description if you
> need more classes.*![](media/image1.jpg){width="5.84375in"
