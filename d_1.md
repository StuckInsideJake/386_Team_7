**1. Introduction: Describe in one paragraph what your project is about.
Make it clear what problem your software is solving.**

We have decided to pursue the development of a health app that will be
made available on mobile devices. This app may potentially be linked to
an online informational page about our team and provide further details
on why we decided to take on this project. Through the app, users will
be able to track their calorie intake for the day, retrieve basic
nutritional information that is based on the information they have
entered, view various exercises, sort exercises by category (i.e. muscle
group), as well as view pictures or descriptions about how to do the
exercise. This app does not have a specific target audience, but the
overall goal is to encourage and motivate an active lifestyle among app
users. We intend to motivate users by also involving them in some sort
of RPG concept that ties their activities into a game for progression.

**2. Initial value proposition and consumer segments: report the initial
guesses for these items.**

Consumer segments include:

1.  Demographics: Age, gender, occupation, etc.

> We believe that our age grouping would be more towards youth to
> graduate students of any gender. For occupation we believe that
> students, personal trainers and gym owners would use it most. We hope
> to use this app to inspire people who don't follow an active lifestyle
> to move more and eat better.

2.  Psychographics: Interests, motivations, activities, lifestyle etc.

> We believe that the lifestyle this app would target would be more of
> those that are sedentary or minimal exercise lifestyle. From this we
> hope that the app would produce better lifestyles and motivate people
> to keep in shape and stay healthy.

3.  Behavioural: Benefits sought, usage rate, etc.

> We believe that our usage rate would be a moderate amount with
> hopefully a few hundred users when the app launches. We hope that it
> will increase in usage as time progresses. The benefits we believe
> will be sought from the app are the idea of living a healthier
> lifestyle as well as continual exercise after usage of the app. We see
> our app being used on a daily basis for the users to be able to keep
> their healthy habits going.

4.  Geographic: Cities, urban/rural, countries etc.

> We think that it can be used anywhere from rural communities to
> metropolitan areas. Along with this we think that nations in Asia such
> as Japan and Korea would find an app like this appealing as well as
> here in the United States.

**3. Interviews Summary: Present the results of each interview (the
minimum number of interviews is 1.5 \* number of participants in the
group).**

For each interview, please report:

• Who was interviewed and who participated in the interview

• When • Consumer segment

• Key insights

• Representative quotes

• Assessment: Must have / Nice to have / Don't care

**[Interview 1:]{.ul}**

Michael Burns was interviewed on January 30th 2021 about the health app
our team will be developing. With him being self motivated with exercise
he did note it would not be for him, but he did note that personal
trainers could use it to help track the progress of their customers.
Along with that he noted with the game portion, it would get more people
out of the house potentially as well as keep those who find it hard to
stay motivated going. He stated that it would be [nice to have an app
like that]{.ul} for exercise. He noted that adding gps could be good as
well as a reminder system for if they haven\'t used the app in a few
days. He noted that it had good potential use for gyms and personal
trainers as well as school teams and their coaching staff. He also
recommended a random exercise a day feature where when active will
randomly pull an exercise up and you would have to do it.

**[Interview 2:]{.ul}**

Robert Seykora, a student here at NAU, was interviewed on February 3rd,
2021. First off, Robert says that he would be a daily user of our app
through iOS. He said that he would use the app mainly for keeping
motivated to stay fit and improve himself physically, something he sees
as a key point for all health apps. He would also use the app for
maintaining muscle and improving heart health. Some features he likes
about the app are the calorie tracker and exercise recommendations. He
sees the tracker idea as something that would keep him coming back to
the app on a daily basis and is a must have. Something he doesn't care
to see at all in the app is the idea of sharing information/progress
with other people across networks. The idea of too many jumping off
questions turned Robert away from the app completely. The idea of
including information and recommendations regarding the importance of
nutrients and vitamins in our proposed diet recommendations is something
that Robert would like to see implemented in the app and would be nice
to have. Lastly, Robert thinks that the app should be free to download
and sign up for but is ok with paying a little bit of money for extra
features.

**[Interview 3:]{.ul}**

Alex Iglesias was interviewed on January 31, 2021. Alex is familiar with
other health apps and was interested in several aspects of our app.
Given his prior experience with health apps, he had some important
questions that related to the long term implementation of it. For
example, he questioned whether customer support would be provided and
proceeded to note that he had been dissatisfied with health apps in the
past due to their lack of customer service and upkeep with
inconsistencies within the app. A key recommendation that Alex had
offered was the ability to take pictures of food products to track their
calorie details for each meal, rather than the user having to manually
input nutritional information. Another question that the interviewee had
was how the point system would work in terms of having a motivational
game aspect to be used with the health tracking app. Although we do not
currently have an answer to this question, this is a good point to
consider if we make it to developing the gaming portion.

**4. Final value proposition and consumer segments:**

After conducting a few interviews with fellow NAU students we came to
the conclusion that our app fits the proposed lifestyles we are suiting
it for: people who struggle to keep up on health-related habits. Our
product is a health focused app, aimed at encouraging teens and young
adults to maintain healthy habits through a competitive gaming aspect
and self motivation, providing the value of healthy habits implemented
in people's everyday lives. We see our product as unique because we
incorporate a gaming aspect into our app that we believe.
